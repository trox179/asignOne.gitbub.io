<h2 style="color:#fc923a; font-size:200%;">Background</h2>
<p style="color:white;">Melbourne born and small country town bred, only to grow up and move back to the city. I grew up in an English-speaking household and despite how many foreign movies or tv shows I watch I am yet to successfully pick up another language but have taken classes in Spanish, French, Italian and Malaysian. As a student I am now in my equivalent second year of a Bachelor of Business Information System. I have a keen interest in Urban gardening. In my spare time and to decompress after a long work-day I love to potter away in my small balcony garden. I started dabbling in hydroponics at the begging of lockdown and have really enjoyed watching my fruits and vegetables grow. I just harvested my first zucchini.</p>

<h2 style="color:#fc923a; font-size:200%;">IT History and Understanding</h2>
<p style="color:white;"> I have been working in the banking industry for the last 8 years, however it was not until I moved to Canada in 2016 that I really started to garner an interest in IT when I was offered a contract as a systems analyst role at the bank I was temping at doing loan administration. I began with assisting the team with remediation programs for systems defects and worked my way up to designing enhancements to the core banking system. What I really enjoyed about the role was taking the time to listen to end users and their experiences and using that knowledge to make their day easier and improve the experience of our customers. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> Why IT? Honesty is always the best option right? My current degree is with Swinburne University however none of the units in my course were being offered this semester. Rather than wasting 3 months of my time sitting idle whilst I waited for the next semester to begin I explored alternative classes that I could be credited towards my degree as an elective. With some help from the good people at Open Universities I was presented with four options and this class seemed the most interesting and appeared to require the least deep commitment knowing that over the Christmas period it would be harder to keep up with the study. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> During my studies I am hoping to learn more about the inner workings of IT projects. Whilst I am not sure programming is going to be in my long term future learning more about the languages and basics will assist me to bridge the gap between the tech and the business. </p>

<h2 style="color:#fc923a; font-size:200%;">The Dream Job </h2>

<a  style="color:#d6d4d2;" href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51015512?type=standout#searchRequestToken=0822d2d7-60eb-4bc3-9d74-b164abea9704 ">View Aesop Product Manager - Busines Systems Role </a>

<p style="color:white;"> Aesop is a Melbourne born company that has been recently awarded a B-Corp certification balancing their purpose and profit, and using business as a source for good in the community and good for the environment. This role is appealing to me as not only is the company looking to do good things that extend beyond profits, but creates the bridge between the technology and the business teams. As the product manager-business systems I would be responsible for defining the strategy and leading the technology roadmap across a number of departments. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> To be the right fit for this role I would need a lot of experience in product management along with strategy. Coming from a banking background I would need to look to shift to a retail company to gain more knowledge on how supply chains and manufacturing works. The company is also looking for experience in particular Information Systems centred around Enterprise Resource Planning software. Along with all of this strong experience in a leadership role and stakeholder management would be required to coordinate the product team which would be made up of a diverse of IT professionals. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> At this point in time I would not be a suitable for the advertised role. Whilst I have leadership experience from my current role, this is at a senior consultant level and not at a team leader or management level. I have exposure to various business information systems but no experience in Enterprise Resource Planning software and its functions however have an aptitude for grasping new business systems easily. I do have a lot of experience in managing customers and expectations and have spent the last 18 months with a customer centric mindset, putting the customer first in all recommendations for processes changes or remediation. In my previous role as a systems analyst I spent a lot of time developing stakeholder relationship and was able to easily converse in both tech and business languages depending on the audience. Coming from that role I also have experience working with developers, business analysts, QA and UAT teams. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> To pursue this role there are a couple of different avenues to take I good first step would be to move into the Retail industry. A lot of the knowledge that will become pivotal in the role will be obtained from having a good foundation within the retail and manufacturing industry. Progressive leadership roles will assist with developing the people skills and project skills that would make me an ideal candidate to take on this role. Combining these two elements along with my Business Information Systems degree once it has been complete would see me become a better fit for this role. </p>

<h2 style="color:#e6e3e1;">Myers-Briggs Test Results - Logician Personality INTP-T</h2>
<p style="color:white;">  The outcomes of this test were not overly surprising when I read through the Logician type. Great at analysis, a little introverted, not great at feelings, not for pointless chit chat. What I did find surprising was that I share traits similar with Bill Gates so where is my excellent idea and all the money that comes with it?  </p>

<h2 style="color:#e6e3e1;">Education Planner.org Learning Style Results - Tactile</h2>

<p style="color:white;">A tactile learner, learns best through touching and doing. I am surprised this didn't return a stronger result as I have always been very hands on and don't like to sit back and watch someone do a task. I work out how to use new programs by testing and trying out its features. </p>

<h2 style="color:#e6e3e1;">But what does this mean?</h2>
<p style="color:white;">The Myers-Briggs test brought to light some strengths in my personality that I was well aware of and are a good reminder of those that are weaker, particularly when it comes to the emotions of others. The tactile learning style was also somewhat un-surprising as I am roll up my sleeves and get stuck in and learn along the way type.   </p>


<p style="color:white;">When it comes to team work I think that I really need to be making space for others feelings and emotions. I tend to dismiss others experiences if I don't find them interesting or am unable to relate. This can make me seem hostile within a team. Also my preference to avoid chit chat and lengthy explanations about items I deem to be irrelevant doesn't necessarily assist in build a collaborative environment. These results also draw to light that I can have great ideas but often don't see them through to execution as I get distracted by  </p>

<p style="color:white;"> When forming a team I need to exercise patience with the other team members and acknowledge that not everyone works the same. It would also be a good idea for me to team up with someone who is good at putting ideas into action so that we stay on track. </p>

<h2 style="color:#fc923a; font-size:200%;">Let's Develop Something New </h2>

<p style="color:white;"> 
When was the last time you took a holiday? In the year of COVID a lot of people cancelled their travel plans or took stay cations instead, but what about before then and what comes next. Welcome to the Vacation Time app, to remind you and assist you in booking your next vacation. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> A good work life balance is one of the most important assets a business can have. One way to have this is to encourage employees to take their annual leave days each year. This delivers two key outcomes for a business. One it improves the employee’s performance and mental health by taking longer breaks to rest and recharge. And two by preventing a build-up of annual leave across the business, large amounts of annual leave can be a financial liability for a business if staff move on and need a large payout, it can also be a performance liability if multiple staff wanting to take vacations at the same time.  </p>
  
<p style="color:white;"> Designed to link in with a business’s HRIS systems the Vacation Time app will alert employees when they have leave building up and encourage them to book vacation time along with presenting the user with suggested travel destinations and offers. Using data from the HRIS system the application will be able to screen for vacation time already booked, days since last vacation, along with suggested periods to take leave based on the collective teams leave calendar. From this information the application can pull information about suggested locations based on time of year and return any travel deals that may be available. </p>


<pre style="color:white;"> Some key features of the application
-	Users will be able to check and project their annual leave balances.
-	Users will be alerted to consider taking leave if they have a certain number of days accrued, and there is no significant period of leave booked within the next 6 – 12 months. A significant period would be anything longer than one week. 
-	Alerts are via email and will also appear as push notifications if a user downloads the app. 
-	The application will provide suggestions on when to take leave based on already booked vacations in the user’s team to encourage business continuity. 
-	Based on the date suggestions the application will return travel suggestions accounting for the season and provide links to potential vacation deals via a 3rd party that may be available to the user to book. 
-	The vacation deals will be hosted on respective third-party websites and will be booked directly with the 3rd party without the business’s involvement. 
-	Provide the user with options to only return deals that fall within certain parameters for example, budget, domestic only, international only, number of potentially travellers, destination type - beach or mountains, holiday type - active or relaxing.
-	Based on the above parameter’s users can also set up alerts to notify them of potential deals that may be advertised that matches their accrued leave balances. 
-	Future development of the application should allow for the user to input that they have school aged children into their profile, adjusting the algorithm to return suggested leave dates based on the school holiday calendar in their state. 
-	The vacation deals will be hosted on respective third-party websites and will be booked directly with the 3rd party and not be linked to the business. 
</pre>
  
<p style="color:white;"> As the project is all software based the hard ware required will be limited to a computer and both a smartphone that operates on the android platform and one on the apple platform to ensure adequate User Acceptance Testing. To develop the software a cloud-based host will need to be sourced to house the software and its data. The software is to be developed in the Java programming language as it is to have a larger pool of developers capable of meeting the requirements. As the software will also offer a downloadable application for smartphones the use of an app builder such as MIT App Inventor may also prove to be of value. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> To develop the project software developers will be required with experience in developing web-based applications with experience in integration into existing software programs. As the project also incorporates a mobile application a software developer with experience both the Apple and Android environments will also be required. Finding developers who meet these requirements should not be a huge challenge as application development and web development can be learned somewhat easily, however the ability to integrate with existing software maybe where the challenges lie. Fortunately as the project is all software based no specific hardware is required other than a computer with a stable internet connection. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> The development of this project will benefit both businesses and employees manage their annual leave. Encouraging employees to take allocated leave may improve their mental health and potentially increase productivity upon their return. With employees more likely to use their leave with the assistance of the application the impacts of carrying high leave balances for the business will be better mitigated. The application also leaves room for further development of the relationship with third party partners to offer travel discounts for employees, based on business referred through the application. </p>
